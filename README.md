#### In light of the huge fever I had over the weekend, I thought it would be a good idea to make an application that diagnosis a users symptoms. 

### It'll work as follows:
- User inputs thier age and gender
- User describes their symptoms
- Application renders multiple possible diagnosis with information on what might have caused it, as well as how to treat it
