#### In light of the huge fever I had over the weekend, I thought it would be a good idea to make an application that diagnosis a users symptoms. This application was done using the vue.js framework

### It'll work as follows:

- User inputs thier age and gender
- User inputs their symptoms
- User inputs their diagnosis and steps to treat it
